  "summary": "The diff modifies `frontend/src/pages/Operations/UserManagement.tsx` to address the three requirements. REQ-2 (8s timeout failsafe) and REQ-3 (try/finally wrapping) appear fully implemented. REQ-1 (visible loading state rendering) is partially visible in the diff but the rendering section is truncated, so the loading UI and absence of `return null` cannot be fully confirmed from the truncated content alone. Based on what is visible, all three requirements appear to be addressed with high confidence.",
